## General Tools

- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in) - an independent alternative to Github that is not tied to any large corporation.
- [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) - domain names quick and cheap
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) - a free alternative to photoshop, not as feature rich, but I like it.
- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) - api testing platform
- [Green Geeks](https://www.greengeeks.com/) - Fast, Secure, Eco-friendly Hosting
- [Signal](https://signal.org/) - secure messaging

## YouTube Channels

- [Coding Train](https://youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain) - This is a channel run by an art professor at NYU he literally [wrote the book](https://natureofcode.com/) on simulating natural systems using code. I like watching the recordings of live streams because you get to see a pro making mistakes and debugging in real time. The coding challenges may seem like small proof of concept things. But they have literally put things in my brain that turned into solutions to work problems on more than one occasion. I SERIOUSLY can't recommend this channel highly enough.
- [Primer](https://youtube.com/c/PrimerLearning) - Nothing to do with code but everything to do with life.
- [CrashCourse](https://youtube.com/user/crashcourse)
  - Specifically [CrashCourse Computer Science](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo) - This playlist doesn't talk about web development but it provides history and presents concepts (levels of abstraction) that are **super** helpful to putting everything in context.
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp) - TONS of good quality tutorials.
- [computerphile](https://youtube.com/user/Computerphile) - This one is chock full of computer science history and concepts. The [videos about encryption and internet security](https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile/search?query=encryption) are particularly helpful for understanding those concepts.
- [Layout Land](https://www.youtube.com/@LayoutLand) - Run by a member of the CSS working group, this channel explains CSS concepts, new and old. Sadly, this also doesn't seem to be updated anymore, but what's there is still good.
- [Mozilla Developer](https://youtube.com/c/MozillaDeveloper) - I have this one on notifications. But it doesn't seem like it's updated anymore. Every video on this channel is pure gold.
  - Start with [Why Is CSS So Weird?](https://youtu.be/aHUtMbJw8iA)
- [Mozilla](https://youtube.com/user/Mozilla)

## Training

I work all these problems on my local machine using Node and it's built in module [Assert](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html) They're great ways to practice and have consistent commits shown on github. Keeping all my work for these in a repo stored there can show employers how I think as a coder.

- [CodeSignal](https://app.codesignal.com/) - A good way to practice.
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard) - More good practice.
- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) - This is an event that runs every december, but you can go back and do previous years.

## Job Hunting

- [Zip Recruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/)

### Job Hunting Advice

- Do NOT put your phone number on ANY website.
- Create an email address that's JUST for jobs and job hunting. Use that one on these sites. Put it on your resume.
- Which jobs do I apply to?
  - Take 10 job descriptions for companies you want to work for.
  - Copy the text and paste it into Word Clouds.
  - This will visualize the common words across all the JDs.
  - See the big words? Use those words on your resume -- authentically.
  - If you don’t have the skill, that tells you what your knowledge gaps are. Nice little 2 for 1 special in this activity.
